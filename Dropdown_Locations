<p>Albertsons's house organic brand costs around 15% less than organic food found elsewhere. Albertsons uses colors to highlight the nutrition of different foods and kids are able to tour the store with a registered dietician.</p>
<h2>Restaurants and Places to Eat</h2>
<h3>Subway</h3>

<p>Subway's customization allows for a nutritionally sound meal. Just pay attention to what meat and sauces you order as that can make the meal less healthy. Opt for whole wheat bread over white bread and load up on veggies.</p>
<h3>Zoe's Kitchen</h3>
<p>The Mediterranean diet has been named one of the most healthiest ways to eat and Zoe's Kitchen provides just that. There is a healthy selection of grilled proteins, veggies, and pita.</p>
<h3>Panera</h3>

<p>Panera offers a You Pick 2 Option that serves a good portion size. They have clean ingredients but tread with caution because the sodium count can drift high and cream based soups can pack unhealthy fats.</p>
